The advantage of pomodoro, is doing shorts, but productives sessions, where you only focus on your tasks. Phones,  entertainements are pushed away, to let  your brain be focused and avoid distraction.

By doing shorts but intensive works session, separate by 5 minutes breaks, studies show that you are far more productive at work than doing a 8hours jobs with random works breaks and no time management.

#### What’s a pomodoro session
Basically, when you pick a task, you start your timer and you should not do anything than your selected task / study for running instance. At the end, a notification is sent that you’ve done your first pomodoro.

You are gifted a 5 minute break.

Then you start again another 25 minutes timer, where you work fully concentrated.

After that you get again a 5 minutes break.

When you’ve done 4 complete timer, you get to have the LONG break, it is 15 minutes.

After the long break, you’ve done a Pomodoro session
